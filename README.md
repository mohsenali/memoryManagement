Memory Management
================

simple implementation of malloc and free 

It is quite simple implementation for the memory management. 
It does not use any linklist but the datastructure it keeps is quite similar to the linked list.
Therefore free is quite quick and so is the merging. 
The malloc does take time if the memory required is not on the top area of the memory buffer. 
It was implemented in about 2 hours (which I believe is quite more than it is required to implement). 

Please feel free to copy, extend and use it. 
Will appreciate if referenced, but it is presented as it is (I cannot take responsibility of 
it's accuracy or not screwing up, >>>>> all the general I am not responsible stuff <<<< )
